# The SenseFlow Data Architecture

## Raw Data sets Used
<img width="442" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d939ab9e-57c2-4d6e-a98a-a5ee304d4e3b" />

## Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Normalization
### Objective: Aggregate scattered raw datasets into a unified, single-schema Data Lake.

* Automated Ingestion: Acted as a "data vacuum," automatically pulling from multiple distinct sources (e.g., Nigerian_Fraud.csv, SpamAssasin.csv, synthetic data).

* Dynamic Normalization: Auto-detected varying column names across different files and forced them into a strict binary schema (text, label).

* Output: Successfully merged disparate data into processed_data.csv, establishing our initial raw dataset of **16,568 emails**.
### Phase 1 Script

                df = pd.read_excel(file, engine='openpyxl')
            else:
                continue # Skip folders or other file types

            # Auto-detect columns
            text_col = 'body' if 'body' in df.columns else 'content' if 'content' in df.columns else 'text' if 'text' in df.columns else None

## Phase 2 - Deep Sanitization & EDA
### Objective: Sterilize the raw data and eliminate hardware-crashing anomalies to make it ML-ready.

* Targeted Noise Reduction: Stripped HTML tags and web links using Regex, while intentionally preserving high-signal "panic symbols" ($, @, !) used in phishing.

* Anomaly & OOM Prevention: Purged 273 exact duplicates to prevent model overfitting, and eradicated a critical 4.2-million-character corrupted log file that would have triggered a GPU Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash.

* Output: Generated senseflow_clean_dataset.csv, resulting in 16,135 pristine, researcher-grade samples perfectly optimized for Transformer training.

## Phase 2B Intervention
***A mutated email that was 4.2 million characters long.***

A fatal dataset flaw discovered during EDA to ensure pipeline and hardware stability. 
We implemented an automated length-filtering gatekeeper (len < 50,000) that scans every row and permanently purges oversized
```python3
import pandas as pd

# 1. Load the dataset we just cleaned
df = pd.read_csv('senseflow_clean_dataset.csv')

# 2. Automated Security Gate: Purge corrupted records (>50k characters)
df = df[df['text'].apply(lambda x: len(str(x)) < 50000)]

# 3. Overwrite the file with the truly clean data
df.to_csv('senseflow_clean_dataset.csv', index=False)

print("✅ Anomalies eradicated. Let's look at the safe stats:")
print(df['text'].apply(lambda x: len(str(x))).describe())
```

* Before Phase 2b Filter: Max text length: 4,296,597 characters

* After Phase 2b Filter: Max text length: 46,332 characters

***What this code does:*** It acts as an automated security checkpoint. It scans the length of every single row. If it finds a row over 50,000 characters, it assumes it is a corrupted log file or a giant block of base64 image code, and it permanently deletes it from the CSV.

The "Why" (Hardware Protection): If you did not run this code, that 4.2-million-character row would have been passed into Phase 3. When the Tokenizer tried to translate 4 million characters at once, it would have overloaded your Colab's RAM and caused a fatal Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash.


The Issue Discovered: After initial text sanitization, our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed a critical hidden anomaly: a single mutated record containing over 4.29 million characters (identified as a corrupted server log/base64 dump).

The Infrastructure Risk: We calculated that passing a multi-million-character sequence to the Hugging Face Tokenizer would immediately exceed the Colab T4 GPU's memory limits, guaranteeing a fatal Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash during training.

The Phase 2b Solution: To solve this, we engineered a dedicated anomaly detection step. , unprocessable artifacts before they can reach the AI model.

## 2. Challenges Faced & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Web Noise & Formatting Junk. The text was full of HTML tags (<br>, <div>) and URLs that distract the AI from reading the actual human intent.
How we fixed it: We used Python re (regex) and html libraries to strip URLs and unescape HTML entities.

### Challenge 2: Preserving "Panic" Context. Standard cleaning removes all special characters, but hackers use specific symbols for financial manipulation.

How we fixed it: We customized the regex filter re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?$@]', '', text) to strictly preserve $, @, !, and ? so the model can still detect urgency and money requests.

### Challenge 3: Duplicates and Blanks. We found completely empty rows and exact copies that would cause the model to overfit.

How we fixed it: We used pandas to apply dropna(subset=['text']) and drop_duplicates(subset=['text']). We removed 11 blanks and 273 exact duplicates.

### Challenge 4: The "Monster" Outlier (Memory Crash Risk). A .describe() audit revealed one row was 4.29 million characters long (likely a corrupted log file). Feeding this to a T4 GPU would trigger an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash.

How we fixed it: We applied a strict length filter ```df[df['text'].apply(lambda x: len(str(x)) < 50000)]```. This eradicated 17 corrupted "monster" rows.

The SenseFlow Presentation Flow
1. The Starting Point (Phase 1: Data Ingestion)

What you show: The Phase 1 slide.

What you say: "To train DistilBERT effectively, we needed a diverse dataset. For Phase 1, we built an automated ingestion pipeline that aggregated multiple distinct threat-intelligence feeds into a single, unified Data Lake, giving us an initial raw dataset of over 16,500 emails."

2. The Cleanup (Phase 2a: Deep Sanitization)

What you show: The Phase 2a slide (HTML/Regex cleaning).

What you say: "Raw data is too noisy for machine learning. In Phase 2a, we applied deterministic regex filtering to strip out HTML artifacts and URLs. Crucially, we preserved high-signal symbols like '$' and '@' which are strong indicators of phishing intent. We also purged exact duplicates to prevent the model from memorizing repetitive data."

3. The Climax (Phase 2b: Hardware Protection)

What you show: The Phase 2b slide (The < 50000 filter).

What you say: "This is where we caught a critical infrastructure risk. During our Exploratory Data Analysis, we discovered a fatal anomaly: a single corrupted record containing 4.29 million characters. If passed to the Hugging Face tokenizer, this would have instantly caused a Colab T4 GPU Out-Of-Memory crash. To guarantee hardware stability, we engineered a Phase 2b automated gatekeeper that permanently purges any sequence over 50,000 characters."

4. The Proof (Final Analytics Report)

What you show: The screenshot of your final analytics (the 16,135 rows, the max length of 46,332).

What you say: "Here is the validation of our pipeline. We successfully reduced the maximum sequence length to a safe 46,000 characters, leaving us with a pristine dataset of exactly 16,135 samples. The class balance is roughly 71% phishing to 28% safe, which accurately mirrors real-world threat environments where spam heavily outweighs legitimate mail."
